## Task 3: Array Methods

Use `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` to loop over an array with 50 objects in it. The [array-methods.js](assignments/array-methods.js) file contains several challenges built around a fundraising 5K fun run event.

* [ ] Review the contents of the [array-methods.js](assignments/array-methods.js) file.  

* [ ] Complete the problems provided to you but skip over stretch problems until you are complete with every other JS file first.

* [ ] Notice the last three problems are up to you to create and solve.  This is an awesome opportunity for you to push your critical thinking about array methods, have fun with it.

## Task 4: Closures

We have learned that closures allow us to access values in scope that have already been invoked (lexical scope).  

**Hint: Utilize debugger statements in your code in combination with your developer tools to easily identify closure values.**

* [ ] Review the contents of the [closure.js](assignments/closure.js) file.  
* [ ] Complete the problems provided to you but skip over stretch problems until you are complete with every other JS file first.

## Stretch Goals

* [ ] Go back through the stretch problems that you skipped over and complete as many as you can.
* [ ] Look up what an IIFE is in JavaScript and experiment with them
